# hello-world
Created by example from: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ tutorial

Well, I was on my way to searching out a WordPress template for one of my classes in Instructional Design and came across so much more.  I have used Github in the past but had no clue what I was doing when using it throuhg Dreamweaver. Updating this md file from https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ tutorial and hoping to learn much more. For now, let me introduce myself as suggested, and then leave so that I can finish homework and return later. My name is Michelle from Texas, I'm a single mom of two teenagers - well adult teenagers now. I switched gears and careers in August of 2019 in hopes of making some life changes. Things have not gone as planned but I'm moving one step at a time and trusting God to take me where He needs me to be.  In Jesus Name.

Have a great year folks.  Se ya later, from Texas.
